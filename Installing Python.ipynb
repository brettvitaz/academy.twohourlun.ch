    "\n",
    "The Python.org distribution will be installed in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/`. Each installed version is listed by its `major.minor` version number, and the executables for Python version 3.5.2 will be found in `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin`. Multiple Python versions can be readily installed and used in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda distribution will be installed in `/anaconda/`, and the executables can be found in `/anaconda/bin/`. When installing as an unprivileged user, Anaconda will be installed into your home directory, with the same path structure otherwise (e.g. `/Users/Brett/anaconda/`). It is important to note that you will only be installing one version of Anaconda. The version of Python is determined at the time of download and managed by the `conda` package manager. Upgrading and switching versions is easy within the same major version (3.4 to 3.5), but creating a separate virtual environment is required for using a different major version. Luckily, this is pretty easy to do, but care should be taken to understand the concept of virtual environments and how to manage them; the topic will be discussed in depth later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The installer will automatically add this directory to your PATH by updating it to the file `~/.bash profile`. The PATH environment variable is a list of directories to instruct your shell where to search for executable files. This allows you to use Python from anywhere by just running `python` from the prompt. Directories in PATH are separated by a colon (`:`) and are read from left to right. This distinction is important, because it is possible to run the incorrect instance of Python or one if its tools. \n",

    "I need to support both major versions of Python, and I have found it useful to install both the Python.org and the Anaconda distributions. My `.bash profile` has the following directives for PATH:\n",

    "export PATH=\"/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/bin:${PATH}\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line adds a directory to the beginning of the path, so the search order is Python 3.5 -> Python 2.7 -> Anaconda. You can view your current PATH by running: \n",

    "```bash\n",

    "OS X comes with Python 2 pre-installed in the directory `/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/`. Even on the latest version of OS X (El Capitan, at the time of this writing), Python is a bit outdated. I recommend keeping up to date on your version of Python by installing the latest from Python.org."
